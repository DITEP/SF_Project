It uses a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN), a certain type of Artificial Neural Network very handy for natural language analysis. Here is how it works.",
    "HANdescriptiontitle":"How does an HAN work ?",

    "HANintroduction": " As explain in the previous paragraph, an HAN is an articial neural network. As such, it is an artifical intelligence tool that is first train on a specific task to perform it as a human being. Here, the task is the binary classification of a report, the HAN answer yes or no to the question : 'Should we introduce this patient in this therapeutic trial ?'. This decision is made based only on text data, that he will read like a human being. Indeed, HAN have the particularity of analysing text word after word, sentence after sentence. It is due to its architecture in 2 layers : a word encoder and a sentence encoder. To this we add an input layer that processes and format the inputs to the network and an output layer that gives the prediction.",
